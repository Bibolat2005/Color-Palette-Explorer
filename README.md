<h1>Color Palette Explorer</h1>
<h3>The project was developed as part of the second stage of selection in the nFactorial incubator.<br></h3>
   I made a box at the top of the web page then I made a display. Colors can be seen in its display. Whenever you create a gradient using two colors, that color can be seen in the display. Then I made a box in which the color code can be found.<br>
   When you input the color of your choice between the two-color input spaces. Then the colors can be seen in the display by connecting them with each other. You can select the angle of your choice using this select box. According to which angle the two colors will be connected to each other<br>
   I did it step by step:<br>
1.Basic structure of Gradient Generator<br>
2.Displaying for Gradient Color viewing<br>
3.CSS color Code viewing Box<br>
4.Creating Space for color Input<br>
5.Selection the box to select the angle<br>

From this task I actually learned more about creation a Gradient Color Generator using HTML CSS JavaScript.Initially, it was a little bit hard in Javascript by doing functions.It was good experince and porject for me.I did it with pleasure and tried my best at short time.Maybe If I had more time, I would do it better.Thank you for giving a chance and wish all best!
